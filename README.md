# Real-Time Anomaly Detection and Prediction in Weather
UChicago Applied Data Science Autumn 2023 Hackathon 3rd Place Winner

- Developed a real-time anomaly detection model using the Pyensign platform and River Python package, focusing on weather data abnormalities, and implemented a Pub/Sub pattern for efficient data handling
- Applied a Half-Space Trees algorithm for anomaly detection, enhancing model accuracy with an Exponential Decay Weighting method to autocorrect the model
- Created a dynamic front-end dashboard using Plotly for real-time visualization of the output
